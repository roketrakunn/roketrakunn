## hi, i'm roket

I like buildng low level tools.

### tools & languages
- C, Assembly (x86)   (First Strong suit)
- Go   (Strong suit)
- Rust   (Another strong suit)
- Zig   (still very limited)
- Java  (When needed)
- Python  (When needed)
- Bash  
- Linux   (YES I DO USE ARAC BTW)

### current focus
- experimenting with a just-in-time compiler.
- Designing what I call DevsArena( Probably will be my biggest project so far)
